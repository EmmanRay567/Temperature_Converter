# Temperature Converter

> **Note:** This project was completed as part of the **COP3014C Programming (C++)** course and is intended to demonstrate fundamental C++ concepts and program logic.

A C++ program that converts temperature values between common measurement units. The program supports **Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Rankine**, allowing conversion from any source unit to any target unit.

## Features

- User inputs:
  - Temperature value
  - Source unit (C, F, K, R)
  - Target unit (C, F, K, R)
- Accurate temperature conversions using standard formulas
- Supports:
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
  - Celsius ↔ Kelvin
  - Celsius ↔ Rankine
  - Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit ↔ Rankine
  - Kelvin ↔ Rankine
  - Identity conversions (e.g., C → C)
- Displays results with two decimal places
